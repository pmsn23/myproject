# My Projects
## Case Study 1: R Shiny Dashboard.
Have tried to use Shiny Dashboard (SD) with Employee Attrition Exploratory Analysis & Machine Learning.. Thanks to Nathan Wall (team member) Dr. John Santire.

We have created Frame work for dynamic scatter plot, bar chart, used the attrition variable as color and shape to differentiate

Have created visuals of histogram and corrogram

Tried Gradiant Boost, Randomforest and the traditional decision tree to understand which ML algorithm is effective

Executed this model before invoking Shiny Server, as these model behaves differently inside the shiny

Have created ROC curve, Variable Importance and Assessment

Created Future Importance Assessment visualization which is dynamic based on Attrition (yes/no)
